# Tranzit
Transportation app for tracking busses

Implementing calls to OC Transpo's Public API to return times for next bus stops on a given route.

in the future I would like to use data from scheduled times vs actual arrival times to predict times better.
I would also like to work with different Ontario bus APIs and integrate them too
